# services
A collection of minor services I'm actively using. Explanations for each of those are located in their subfolders.

## Archived services
These are services which I previously used, and they can be found at my [archive repository](https://github.com/KockaAdmiralac/Archive) now:

## Moved services
These services have been moved out of this repository, due to having a better place someplace else:

- [Updating Highlight.css on Fandom Developers Wiki](https://github.com/WikiaUsers/highlight)
